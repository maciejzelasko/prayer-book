    let us kneel before the Lord, our Maker!<br>

    <p>"Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,<br>
    for he has visited and redeemed his people<br>
    and has raised up a horn of salvation for us<br>
    in the house of his servant David,</p>
    
    <p>as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old,<br>
    that we should be saved from our enemies<br>
    and from the hand of all who hate us;</p>
    
    <p>to show the mercy promised to our fathers<br>
    and to remember his holy covenant,<br>
    the oath that he swore to our father Abraham, to grant us<br>
    that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies,<br>
    might serve him without fear,<br>
    in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.</p>
    
    <p>And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High;<br>
    for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,<br>
    to give knowledge of salvation to his people<br>
    in the forgiveness of their sins,<br>
    because of the tender mercy of our God,<br>
    whereby the sunrise shall visit us from on high<br>
    to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,<br>
    to guide our feet into the way of peace."</p>
