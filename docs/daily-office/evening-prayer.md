  <div class="prayer-text">
    <p>O Lord, I call upon you; hasten to me!<br>
    Give ear to my voice when I call to you!<br>
    Let my prayer be counted as incense before you,<br>
    and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice!</p>
    
    <p>Set a guard, O Lord, over my mouth;<br>
    keep watch over the door of my lips!<br>
    Do not let my heart incline to any evil thing,<br>
    to busy myself with wicked deeds in company with men who work iniquity,<br>
    and let me not eat of their delicacies!</p>
    
    <p>But my eyes are toward you, O God, my Lord;<br>
    in you I seek refuge; leave me not defenseless!<br>
    Keep me from the trap that they have laid for me<br>
    and from the snares of evildoers!</p>

  <div class="prayer-text">
    <p>"My soul magnifies the Lord,<br>
    and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,<br>
    for he has looked on the humble estate of his servant.<br>
    For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed;</p>
    
    <p>for he who is mighty has done great things for me,<br>
    and holy is his name.<br>
    And his mercy is for those who fear him<br>
    from generation to generation.</p>
    
    <p>He has shown strength with his arm;<br>
    he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts;<br>
    he has brought down the mighty from their thrones<br>
    and exalted those of humble estate;</p>
    
    <p>he has filled the hungry with good things,<br>
    and the rich he has sent away empty.<br>
    He has helped his servant Israel,<br>
    in remembrance of his mercy,<br>
    as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his offspring forever."</p>
