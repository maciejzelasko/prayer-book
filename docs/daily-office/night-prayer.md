## Night Psalm - Psalm 91

<div class="reading">
  <div class="reading-reference">Psalm 91:1-6, 11-16</div>
  <div class="prayer-text">
    <p>He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High<br>
    will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.<br>
    I will say to the Lord, "My refuge and my fortress,<br>
    my God, in whom I trust."</p>
    
    <p>For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler<br>
    and from the deadly pestilence.<br>
    He will cover you with his pinions,<br>
    and under his wings you will find refuge;<br>
    his faithfulness is a shield and buckler.</p>
    
    <p>You will not fear the terror of the night,<br>
    nor the arrow that flies by day,<br>
    nor the pestilence that stalks in darkness,<br>
    nor the destruction that wastes at noonday.</p>
    
    <p>For he will command his angels concerning you<br>
    to guard you in all your ways.<br>
    On their hands they will bear you up,<br>
    lest you strike your foot against a stone.</p>
    
    <p>You will tread on the lion and the adder;<br>
    the young lion and the serpent you will trample underfoot.<br>
    "Because he holds fast to me in love, I will deliver him;<br>
    I will protect him, because he knows my name.</p>
    
    <p>When he calls to me, I will answer him;<br>
    I will be with him in trouble;<br>
    I will rescue him and honor him.<br>
    With long life I will satisfy him<br>
    and show him my salvation."</p>
